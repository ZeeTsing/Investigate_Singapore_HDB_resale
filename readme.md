# Singapore's "Kiasu" parents? Understand HDB resale prices

This project aims to understand the HDB resale pricing trend and predict new entries. We are interested particularly in whether primary school presence and location has effect on the HDB resale prices.

Data source from data.gov.sg, OneMap and HDB.

The map below shows our model's prediction result v.s. actual resale price.
